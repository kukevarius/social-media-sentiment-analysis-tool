# Social Media Sentiment Analysis Tool
This project is a program that uses natural language processing and machine learning techniques to analyze social media posts and determine the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of the text. The program can be used by businesses to monitor their brand reputation online by analyzing the sentiment of tweets, Facebook posts, or other social media content related to their brand.

# Getting Started
To use the social media sentiment analysis tool, you will need to install the required packages and set up the necessary credentials for accessing the Twitter API (or other social media platforms). Here are the steps to get started:

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  Install the required packages by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
3.  Set up your Twitter API credentials by creating a new app at https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps and obtaining your consumer key, consumer secret, access token, and access token secret.
4.  Run the program by executing python main.py.

# Usage
The social media sentiment analysis tool accepts social media posts as input and outputs the sentiment of the text. Here's how you can use the tool:

1.  Enter the search query for the social media posts you want to analyze (e.g., a brand name or keyword).
2.  Choose the social media platform you want to analyze (currently only Twitter is supported).
3.  Choose the time period for the search (e.g., last 7 days or last 30 days).
4.  The program will collect the social media posts and analyze their sentiment using natural language processing and machine learning techniques.
5.  The program will output the sentiment analysis results in the console and save them in a CSV file in the output directory.

# Customization
The social media sentiment analysis tool can be customized based on your specific requirements and use case. Here are some ways you can customize the tool:

Modify the preprocessing techniques to improve the quality of the data.
Use a different machine learning algorithm to train the sentiment analysis model.
Deploy the tool as a web application or API for easy integration with other applications.
